#### Booking a rental

#### Starting a rental

You can only start a rental only if you made a booking. To start a rental you need to go to the Designated Parking Zone, open the Zenway app and start the rental by unlocking the Vehicle via the Zenway app. You must have an internet connection on your mobile device in order to unlock the Vehicle.

Before using your Vehicle, it is your responsibility to conduct basic safety checks including a visual inspection, checking the battery level and testing the brakes. You must not use the Vehicle if there are any noticeable issues (such as, amongst other things, visible damage to the Vehicle’s wheels, brakes, lights or frame, issues in relation to the battery level, signs of unusual or excessive wear of any kind or any other visual damage to the Vehicle or any malfunction of the brakes). If You notice any such issues with the Vehicle, You must not use the Vehicle. We would appreciate it if You let us know about such an issue in accordance with the information in Section 8 below.


#### During your ride

If the battery of your e-bike is depleted during your ride, the motor assistance will be cut out, you will however, be able to continue your ride by pedalling. You are still required to return the bike to the Designated Parking Zone before the end of your rental.


#### Pausing the ride and leaving the bike unattended

Whenever pausing the ride or leaving the bike unattended you must secure the Vehicle as per Section 1.4. You can then unlock the Vehicle using the App. You will require an internet connection in order to do this by pausing the ride via the Zenway app.  

When you leave the bike unattended outside of the Designated Parking Zone, you will still be charged for the use of the Vehicle.

The Vehicle must not be left outside overnight.


#### Ending a rental

To end your rental, you must return the Vehicle to the Designated Parking Zone and end the ride using the app and secure the Vehicle according to Section 1.4. If a charging cable is available, the Vehicle must be plugged in. Failure to do so will mean you will continue to be charged for the Vehicle at the highest rate.

You must return your Vehicle before the end of your rental period. Other users may have booked the Vehicle and will be disappointed if you do not return it promptly. 

In the event you need to extend your booking, this may be possible in the app depending on other bookings. You must do this before the end of your booked rental period.

If you overrun your rental period without extending it, you will be charged a fee of £30.
