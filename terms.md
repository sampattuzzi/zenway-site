## 1. General


### 1.1 Parties to the agreement

You and Zenway are the sole parties to this Agreement. You are the sole user of the Services and You must not allow any others to use the Vehicle or access your account with us.


### 1.2 Register account

In order to use the Services, You must register an account in the Zenway App. You have to follow the instructions given during the registration procedure and provide correct information. Without proper registration You must not use the Services. You may only register one account for You and shall only undertake one registration. You shall make sure that no one else but You makes use of Your registration, particularly with regard to using a Vehicle. If You become aware of the risk that someone else uses Your registration or could use Your registration, for example because Your computer or mobile device by which You may access the Vehicle has been stolen, You shall inform Zenway as soon as possible in accordance with Section 8.  If you allow a third party to use Your registration or a Vehicle, You will be responsible for any and all use and/or misuse of the Services by them or any other third party accessing your account and/or any Vehicle via your account.


### 1.3 Zenway services

Zenway shall provide You with the opportunity to use the Zenway App in order to book, activate, use and deactivate a Vehicle if there is a Vehicle available. 


### 1.4 Your responsibility and requirement to use the service

You must be at least 16 years of age to use our Vehicles. If You allow a minor to use a Vehicle by e.g. activating it through Your account, You shall be responsible for any and all use and/or misuse. A minor is any person under the age of 16.

You must be physically fit and reasonably competent to use the Vehicle, particularly with regard to taking part in street traffic and complying with traffic rules and regulations and following the Highway Code for cyclists including but not limited to:



* Each person using a Vehicle is wearing a well-fitting helmet.
* Adapting your driving style to external circumstances and your general ability.
* Wearing reflective or high visibility clothing in poor weather or at night and switching on the Vehicle's lights.

You must not take a Vehicle outside of the United Kingdom during your rental period or otherwise.

During your rental, it is your responsibility to ensure the Vehicle is always secured while unattended. You must secure the Vehicle using the provided Ring Lock and Chain. The Chain must be attached securely to an Immovable Object.

Where you are using an E-Bike + trailer, the trailer will remain attached to the E-bike unless you choose to detach it. Terms relating to locking and unlocking the trailer from the E-bike are set out in section 1.7. You are recommended to attach/detach the trailer to the E-Bike outside of the building in order to safely maneuver inside the building. 


### 1.5 Availability of the services

Your access to Vehicles shall be subject to availability, save we have a private agreement with you in relation to a specific Vehicle where you have reserved access for a specified Period. We are not responsible if You are unable to locate an available Vehicle and we make no warranty or representation that Vehicles will be available.

Availability of Vehicles may differ within a Building due to high demand.

Zenway will make every effort to make the Vehicle available at the start of your booking. However, Zenway accepts no liability if a Vehicle is not available either because it has not been returned or is not in a rideable condition for any reason. In this case, You will be eligible for a refund of the full booking amount. If this is the case, you must alert Zenway as soon as possible in accordance with this Agreement.


### 1.6 Your use of the services


#### Booking a rental

You have to use your personal account in the Zenway app to book a Vehicle before starting a ride. Booking a ride implies choosing the type of Vehicle you want to hire, rental starting date & time, rental ending date & time and paying for the rental duration. When you make a booking, you can choose which type of Vehicle you would like to rent, subject to availability in your Building.



#### Starting a rental

You can only start a rental once you have made a booking. To start a rental you need to go to the Designated Parking Zone, open the Zenway app and start the rental by unlocking the Vehicle via the Zenway app. You must have an internet connection on your mobile device in order to unlock the Vehicle.

Before using your Vehicle, it is your responsibility to conduct basic safety checks including but not limited to a visual inspection, checking the battery level and testing the brakes, and in the case of an E-Bike + trailer, checking if the trailer is properly attached before starting the ride. Instructions on how to attach the trailer to the E-Bike are shown on a poster in the bike storage room in the building. You must not use the Vehicle if there are any noticeable issues (such as, amongst other things, visible damage to the Vehicle’s wheels, brakes, lights or frame, issues in relation to the battery level, signs of unusual or excessive wear of any kind or any other visual damage to the Vehicle or any malfunction of the brakes). If You notice any such issues with the Vehicle, You must not use the Vehicle. We would appreciate it if You let us know about such an issue in accordance with the information in Section 8 below. You will be required to demonstrate the issue to us in order to qualify for a refund where you have pre-paid for access to a Vehicle which is not in suitable condition to be used.


#### During your ride

If the battery of your Vehicle is depleted during your ride, the motor assistance will be cut out. You will however, be able to continue your ride by pedalling. You are still required to return the Vehicle to the Designated Parking Zone before the end of your rental. When renting a Vehicle, you are accepting that you may be required to pedal the Vehicle manually in cases where the battery runs out.


#### Pausing the ride and leaving the Vehicle unattended

Whenever pausing the ride or leaving the Vehicle unattended you must secure the Vehicle as per Section 1.4. You can then unlock the Vehicle using the App. You will require an internet connection in order to do this by pausing the ride via the Zenway app.  

When you leave the Vehicle unattended outside of the Designated Parking Zone, you will still be charged for the use of the Vehicle.

The Vehicle must not be left outside overnight.


#### Ending a rental

To end your rental, you must return the Vehicle to the Designated Parking Zone and end the ride using the app and secure the Vehicle according to Section 1.4. If a charging cable is available, the Vehicle must be plugged in. Failure to do so will mean you will continue to be charged for the Vehicle at the highest rate.

You must return your Vehicle before the end of your rental period. Other users may have booked the Vehicle and your failure to return in promptly may inconvenience others. We reserve the right to sanction users as we see fit in all circumstances, and in particular where a user fails to return a Vehicle before the end of an agreed rental period. 

In the event you need to extend your booking, this may be possible in the app depending on other bookings. You must do this before the end of your booked rental period.

If you overrun your rental period without extending it, you will be charged a late fee of £30.


#### Safety measures while using the service 

You have to use the Vehicle in a safe manner and take necessary measures to avoid, amongst other things, accidents and damage to persons and property. Such safety measures include, but are not limited to, the following:



* To never exceed the maximum weight of 120 kg(kilograms) when using the E-bikes. The maximum weight includes all items carried by You in compliance with this Agreement.
* To never exceed the maximum weight of 120 kg(kilograms) when using the E-scooters. The maximum weight includes all items carried by You in compliance with this Agreement.
* To never exceed the maximum weight of 250 kg(kilograms) in the trailer of an E-Bike + trailer. The maximum weight includes all items carried by You in compliance with this Agreement. The weight of the rider must not exceed 125 kg(kilograms).

* To never use the Vehicle for competitions, races or equivalent events, including both professional and non-professional stunt or trick riding.



#### Proper use of services

You shall return the Vehicle in the same condition in which it was rented and the Vehicle must be fit for immediate usage by other users, given normal wear and tear and with the exclusion of low battery level.  You may never tamper with the Zenway App or Vehicles in any way and for any reason. You are responsible and liable for any damages suffered by Zenway relating to Your use of the Services, where you have not complied with the terms of this Agreement. This includes any indirect losses such as Zenway’s loss of income due to riding without payment, due to tampering of the Vehicle as well as a Vehicle being unfit for use by other users.



### 1.7 Lost, Damaged, Stolen Vehicles and Accidents

If a Vehicle (or the trailer attached to a vehicle) is stolen during your rental, you will be required to pay a £100 fee per Vehicle or trailer, or a fee of £200 per Vehicle where an E-trailer bike is stolen comprising the E-bike and the accompanying trailer. If you did not secure the Vehicle in accordance with Section 1.4, you will be liable for the entire cost of the Vehicle. To avoid this, you must ensure you always lock to an Immovable Object when leaving the Vehicle unattended and leave the Vehicle in a safe place where it is unlikely to be the target of theft.

Where you are using an E-Bike + trailer, you will be able to request from your Building manager, concierge or equivalent (“**Building Manager**”), a chain lock key to detach the trainer from the E-bike. Keys must be returned to the Building Manager at the end of the rental period. Failure to return such keys or loss of such keys will entitle Zenway to charge up to the abovementioned £100 fee relating to Vehicle loss to cover the cost of replacement keys, administration and where Zenway deem it appropriate, replacement of the chain lock itself.

If you do not return your Vehicle after 8 hours from the end of your rental period, we will deem the Vehicle stolen. We will try to contact You at this time but if no resolution can be found within 48 hours we will charge you for the cost of replacing the Vehicle.

In the event that the Vehicle has been accidentally damaged during your rental, you will be required to pay a fee of up to £50 towards the repairs. If the damage is deemed to be deliberate or negligent, you will be liable for the whole cost of repairs or replacement as deemed necessary by Zenway.

You must let us know if the Vehicle is stolen, damaged, or injuries to yourself or others or if you have been in a crash of any sort as soon as possible via email.

You authorise us to charge all payments set out in this section to your selected payment method.


## 2. Payment

### 2.4 Outstanding payments

Any outstanding payment of prices for the use of Vehicles by You or any fee charged on the grounds of this Agreement will be made by Us by using the payment method described in Section 2.3. If, however, for such payment cannot be made on account of a reason within Your control (wrong credit card number, change of credit card without notification or similar), Zenway will inform You and set a period in order to rectify the situation. Until then Zenway is entitled to suspend any rental of Vehicles. If Zenway has not received information about a reliable payment method within two weeks, Zenway may terminate this Agreement and restrict or block Your access to the Services. In any case, we are entitled to restrict Your access to any Vehicle whilst sums are owed by You to Zenway.

## 3. Liability


### 3.1 Limitation of Liability

We do not exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors and for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. However, please note that the following will generally not be due to our negligence and are beyond our reasonable control: (a) road or other incidents occurring whilst you are using a Vehicle rented through Zenway, regardless of whether You or any third party are at fault causing the accident, or (b) incidents occurring because the Vehicle was not in rideable condition at the time you began the rental, but you began using the Vehicle in any case, or (c) incidents occurring because the Vehicle cease being in drivable condition during your rental period, for example due to any incident occurring or other damage occurring to the Vehicle during your rental period, and you continued using the Vehicle thereafter.

All users understand and acknowledge that Zenway is a booking and Vehicle rental service, and each user is responsible for their own actions, omissions, decision-making, and general safety.

However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow download, installation, or usage instructions or to have in place the minimum system requirements and anti-virus software.

Your choices are your own.


### 3.4 Liability Cap 

Subject to the foregoing and applicable law, our maximum liability to you is capped at the total fees or other amounts paid by you to us in the 12 months preceding the applicable liability claim. 


### 3.5 Force Majeure 

Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement if such delay or failure result from events, circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control.

Availability of our Platform and/or Vehicles may also be interrupted in the case of events or occurrences beyond our reasonable control. We will not be liable to you if for any reason the Platform or Vehicles are unavailable at any time or for any period, including where we have informed you that it or they will be available at a specific time but it is not for any reason.


### 3.7 Websites We Link To 

The Platform may link to other third party websites from which third party services can be obtained, including those of Buildings or associated companies where Vehicles are located, which are separate from Zenway. Whilst we reasonably believe that these are reputable sources and websites, you acknowledge that these other websites are independent from us and we make no representations or warranties as to the legitimacy, accuracy or quality of such third party websites or their offerings, and we do not accept any responsibility for their content, safety, practices or privacy policies. You access any third party website or services at your own risk.


### 3.8 Viruses 

We do everything we can to ensure that no part of the Platform will contain or spread any viruses or other malicious code but this section explains how you can best protect your devices.  

We recommend that you ensure that equipment used to access the Platform run up-to-date anti-virus software as a precaution, and you are advised to virus-check any materials downloaded from the Platform (if applicable) and regularly check for the presence of viruses and other malicious code. 

To the full extent permitted by law we exclude liability for damage or loss of any kind caused by viruses or other harmful components originating or contracted from the Platform.


### 3.9 No Reliance on Information

All information published on or via the Platform is provided in good faith and for general information purposes only.

Zenway will use its reasonable efforts to respond to and address complaints. However, Zenway will not be entitled or able to resolve disputes in respect between users (for example relating to a Vehicle) or between a user and a third party (for example relating to an incident between that user and such third party involving the Vehicle). Zenway may be able to provide evidence at any applicable hearing or tribunal provided that it is reimbursed for its time, expenses and administrative costs of doing so.


### 4.3 Proprietary Rights 

You acknowledge and agree that Zenway and/or its licensors own all intellectual property rights in the Services and the Platform.

## 7. Miscellaneous Legal Terms

We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement. You may not assign or transfer any rights you may have under this Agreement without our prior written approval, given at our absolute discretion.

This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Zenway, notwithstanding that you may have viewed marketing materials of Zenway prior to entering into this Agreement.

None of the rights or obligations under this Agreement are enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by a person who is not a party to this Agreement.

Under this Agreement, you are granted a licence only in respect of our Platform. Any payments made are in consideration for a licence to access our Platform. We retain ownership in the Platform at all times.

If we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that does not mean that we have waived our rights against you, and it does not mean that you are relieved of your obligations under this Agreement. If we do waive a breach by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later breach by you.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.

Subject to any applicable law and consumer rights, this Agreement are the full agreement between us and our users. 

These Terms are governed by English law and the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction. 

Although this Agreement qualifies as a distance contract (concluded electronically without You and Zenway being physically present), please note that you have no right of withdrawal because the Service provided is the rental of Vehicles (please see regulation 28(1)(h) of the Consumer Contracts Regulations).

Zenway is our trademark.
